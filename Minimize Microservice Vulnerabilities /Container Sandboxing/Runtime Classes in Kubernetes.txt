- When we use gVisor runsc runtime as a RuntimeClass object resource, the runtime isolate the container processes
from the host.

- Say for example you create nginx pod specifying the runtime class with runsc, if you want to find the nginx process
in the host like this: pgrep -a nginx -> you won't find it, but it if pgrep -a runsc -> you will find it

- To check the default runtime in kubernetes cluster, check this folder:
  cd /var/run/containerd

Example of RuntimeClass object:
# RuntimeClass is defined in the node.k8s.io API group
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  # The name the RuntimeClass will be referenced by.
  # RuntimeClass is a non-namespaced resource.
  name: myclass
# The name of the corresponding CRI configuration
handler: myconfiguration


Usage in the pod:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  runtimeClassName: myclass
