- Kata Containers is a sandbox tool

- Kata installs each container into its own separate virtual machine, and each container will have its own
  dedicated kernel running inside.

- The virtual machines created by kata are lightweight and more focused on performance.

- kata uses nested virtualization (vm inside vm) and that's not supported by many cloud providers
