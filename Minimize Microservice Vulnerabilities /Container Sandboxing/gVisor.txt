- gVisor is a sandbox tool

- The aim of gVisor is to have additional layer of security between the container and the operating system kernel

- gVisor is a tool from Google that allows an additional layer of isolation between the container and the kernel.

- gVisor sandbox consists of two major components that work together to achieve stronger isolation when compared
  to traditional containers:
  1. Sentry
     - independent application-level kernel which is dedicated for containers.
     - The main purpose of Sentry is to intercept and respond to system calls which are made by containerized
       applications.
     - It supports far fewer functionality than the actual linux kernel.
  2. Gofer
    - if the application needs access to a file, Sentry cannot make the access system call directly
      to the linux kernel, Instead, Sentry talks to a dedicated process called Gofer (Gofer is a file proxy that
      implements the logic that is needed for the containerized apps to access the system files).
      This is like a middleman which is sitting between the container and the operating system.

- Each containerized environment has its own dedicated gVisor kernel (This means that each container would now
  be isolated it its own virtualized sandbox which reduces the attack surface)
