- Third-party programs like Istio and Linkerd (Service Mesh) are facilitate mTLS encryption between pods

- They allow secure service-to-service communication without depending on the applications

- Istio inserts a sidecar container to all the pods.

- The Istio sidecar container intercepts the messages between the pods before it leaves the network
- It then encrypts the message and send through the network.
- Once the encrypted message received by the other pod, it'll be decrypted by the sidecar container in that pod.
- If we've an external service reaching on of the pods inside the cluster, it's not implementing mTLS encryption
  as Istio do in the cluster, for that the messages are sent in a plain text to that service
