- To implement fine-grain control over the processes running inside the container we've to make use of AppArmor

- AppArmor is a Linux security module that used to confine a program to a limited set of resources.

- To check if AppArmor is installed and running, run systemctl status apparmor

- Check the following file in kubernetes node to check if apparmor is loaded:
  - cat /sys/module/apparmor/parameters/enabled
  - You'll see either Y or N

- Just like seccomp, AppArmor is applied to an application via a profile
  - This profile must be loaded in the kernel
    - Check if it's loaded: cat /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/profiles

- AppArmor profiles are simple text files that define what resources can be used by an application
- These include linux capabilities, network resources, file resources, etc...

- We can check the status of AppArmor using the following command:
  aa-status

- AppArmor profiles can be loaded in three different modes:
  - enforce -> AppArmor will enforce and monitor the rules
  - complain -> AppArmor will allow the application tasks without any restrictions, but it'll then log them as events.
  - unconfined -> AppArmor will allow the application tasks, but AppArmor will not log any events
