- Since we disable the root access ssh for the remote server, there are times when we need to execute
  a superuser commands

- We can use sudo

- The default configuration for sudo is defined under the /etc/sudoers file
- This file can be updated using the visudo command

- We can eliminate the need for ever having to login as a root user directly using the following command:
  grep -I ^root /etc/passwd

Example:
Create a user named jim on node01 host and configure password-less ssh access from controlplane host
(from user root) to node01 host (to user jim).

Solution:
ssh into node01 host from controlplane host
ssh node01

Create user jim on node01 host
adduser jim (set any password you like)

Return back to controlplane host and copy ssh public key
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub jim@node01

Test ssh access from controlplane host
ssh jim@node0
