- The kernel is divided into two areas:
  - Kernel space
    - Kernel Code, Extensions, and Device Drivers are running inside the kernel
  - User space
    - Applications like C, Java, C++ are running inside the user space

- If you want a file, say for example (touch /tmp/error.log)
  - It'll make several system calls
  - One of them is execve system call that executes the touch binary
  - A few other calls are:
    - open()
    - close()
    - execve()
    - readdir()
    - strlen()
    - closedir()


- Tracing SYSCALLS
  - which strace -> /usr/bin/strace
  - it's useful to trace the system calls used by an application
  - Example: strace touch /tmp/error.log
  - The 23 vars that comes from the output is implies that 23 variables were inherited by the system call
    - We can verify this by checking the number of environment variables defined in the user shell
      by running the env command like this: env | wc -l

  - To trace the syscalls used by a running process we first need to determine the process id
  - Example: pidof etcd -> 3569
             strace -p 3569 -> return all the future syscalls made by etcd.

  - To see all the syscalls used by a command, use the strace -c touch /tmp/error.log
