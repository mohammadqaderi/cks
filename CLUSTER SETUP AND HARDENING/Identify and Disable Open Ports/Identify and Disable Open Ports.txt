- To check if a port is used and listening for connection requests, use the following command:
  netstat -an | grep -w LISTEN

- Always check the open ports when installing a new package or software from the official docs from that package/software.

- If you want to look at what port 53 is used for, you can check the services file by this:
  cat /etc/services | grep -w 53


- Lab Question:
We have a service running on controlplane host which is listening on port 9090.
Identify the service and stop the same to free the 9090 port.

#Solution
nestat -natp | grep -w 9090 -> return the package name
systemctl remove PACKAGE_NAME
