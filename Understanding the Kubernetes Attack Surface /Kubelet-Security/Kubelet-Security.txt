- The Kubelet configuration is exists in Kubernetes resource called KubeletConfiguration
in a file path called kubelet-config in /var/lib/kubelet/kubelet-config.yaml

- In Kubelet service, it points to kubelet-config file using config parameter

- Kubelet serves on two ports:
  - 10250: Serves API that allow full access
  - 10255: Serves API that allow unauthenticated read-only access

- curl -sk https://localhost:10250/pods/
  - list pods in the node

- curl -sk https://localhost:10255/metrics/
  - show detailed information about the node metrics (but anyone knows the IP of that node can see this information
  and this is a big risk)

- The best practice is to disable the anonymous authentication in the kubelet configuration and enable one of
the authentication mechanisms.

- Kubelet Authentication Mechanisms:
 - Certificate Based Authentication
   - We'll have a ca.crt file that we'll provide it in the kubelet service configuration in a parameter called
    --ca-client-file
   - You can set this file in kubelet configuration file in the following property:
       authentication:
         x509:
           clientCAFile: ca.crt
   - When you call the kubelet endpoint, you've to provide the ca file in the request:
     curl -sk https://localhost:10250/pods/ --key kubelet-key.pem --cert kubelet-cert.pem
 - API Bearer Tokens

- Kubelet Authorization
 - The default authorization mode in the kubelet config is AlwaysAllow
 - To prevent this, change the authorization mode to Webhook
 - Regarding the 10255 port access, it depends on a key called read-only-port in kubelet service configuration
   - if it set to 0, then it's disabled
   - This key is exists in kubelet config file called readOnlyPort
