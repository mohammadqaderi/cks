- Falco needs to see what system calls are coming through the applications in the user space into the Linux kernel.
- It has to insert itself in the kernel, to set in the middle and see what's coming in.
- Falco can interact with the kernel through EBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter).
- The system calls are then analyzed by the cystic libraries in the user space.
- The events are then filtered by the Falco policy engine by making use of the predefined rules that can detect
  whether the events were suspicious or not.
- Such an event is then alerted via various output channels such as CIS log files, standard outputs, or Slack channel.
- Installation:
  - Install it using a falco kernel package from the official website.
  - Install it using DaemonSet.
