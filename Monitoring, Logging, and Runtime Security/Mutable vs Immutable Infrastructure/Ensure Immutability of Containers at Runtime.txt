- Achieving Container Immutability in kubernetes can be done in different ways.

- Restricting the copy for kubernetes pod container:
  - Add the securityContext with readOnlyRootFilesystem property under the container spec
  - This property can break the pod and prevent it from start, because the restriction is made to the whole file system
    inside the hist.
  - To fix this, you can add a volumes property to make allow the container to write data to a specific locations.

- As a note stick to these best practices:
  - do not use privileged
  - do not user runAsUser: 0 (and use different user id)

Question:
Delete pods from alpha namespace which are not immutable.

Note: Any pod which uses elevated privileges and can store state
inside the container is considered to be non-immutable.

Pod solaris is immutable as it have readOnlyRootFilesystem: true, so it should not be deleted.

Pod sonata is running with privileged: true and triton doesn't
define readOnlyRootFilesystem: true so both break the concept of immutability and should be deleted.
